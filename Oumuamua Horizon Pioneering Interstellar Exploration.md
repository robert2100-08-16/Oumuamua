### **Oumuamua Horizon: Pioneering Interstellar Exploration**

**Introduction**

On October 19, 2017, ʻOumuamua, the first known interstellar visitor, was discovered as it passed through our solar system. With its extraordinary speed and peculiar shape, ʻOumuamua immediately sparked the curiosity of the scientific community. However, only a few months later, it was out of range of Earth-based telescopes, leaving its mysteries unsolved. The mission **"Oumuamua Horizon"** aims to chase down this enigmatic object, investigate it up close, and answer fundamental questions about the composition and origins of interstellar objects.

### **Mission Objectives**

The mission has three main objectives:

1. **Catch up to ʻOumuamua**: The spacecraft must cover the vast distance over approximately five years while exceeding the object’s velocity (~26.33 km/s relative to the Sun).

2. **Fly alongside and investigate**: While flying parallel to ʻOumuamua, the spacecraft will use cameras, spectrometers, and particle collectors to gather data on its composition, structure, and physical properties.

3. **Deploy a lander**: A compact robotic lander will touch down on ʻOumuamua’s surface to perform direct sample analysis and study the surface material.

### **Technological Variants**

The technical challenges for this mission are immense. Catching up to an object moving so fast requires an innovative propulsion system. Two main approaches were analyzed:

#### **1. Nuclear Thermal Propulsion**
- **Technology**: A nuclear reactor heats liquid hydrogen, which serves as the propellant. With a specific impulse (I\(_\text{sp}\)) of ~900 seconds, this is significantly more efficient than chemical propulsion.
- **Feasibility**: This technology is relatively mature (e.g., NASA’s NERVA program in the 1970s) and could be ready for launch by 2030.
- **Challenges**: Cryogenic tanks and reactor integration add complexity to the mission.

#### **2. Solar or Laser-Powered Lightsail**
- **Technology**: A large, reflective sail is accelerated by Earth-based lasers or solar radiation.
- **Potential**: Theoretically capable of reaching speeds of 0.1-0.2 c.
- **Challenges**: The required laser infrastructure does not yet exist, and development time exceeds the 2030 launch goal.

**Conclusion**: **Nuclear thermal propulsion** is the most feasible solution for a launch by the late 2020s.

### **Mission Plan**

1. **Launch and Acceleration**:
   - The spacecraft will be launched into low Earth orbit (LEO) using a heavy-lift rocket (e.g., SpaceX Starship or NASA SLS). A nuclear propulsion system will then accelerate it to over 40 km/s relative to the Sun.

2. **Chasing ʻOumuamua**:
   - After a ~5-year journey, the spacecraft will reach ʻOumuamua and enter a parallel trajectory.

3. **Data Collection**:
   - From a close distance of a few kilometers, the spacecraft will study ʻOumuamua’s chemical and physical properties and capture high-resolution images.

4. **Deploying the Lander**:
   - A robotic lander will softly land on ʻOumuamua, conduct sample analyses on-site, and collect detailed data about the surface.

5. **Data Transmission**:
   - All data will be sent back to Earth via the Deep Space Network (DSN). The total mission duration is estimated at 10-15 years.

### **Cost and Feasibility**

The mission’s estimated cost is **~$1.5-2 billion USD**, comparable to complex interplanetary missions like Cassini-Huygens or the Mars Sample Return Mission. A development timeline of six to eight years makes a launch by 2030 realistic.

#### **7. Fuel Requirements**

**Given:**
- \(\Delta v = 40,000\) m/s (required velocity change).
- \(I_\text{sp} = 900\) seconds (specific impulse of nuclear thermal propulsion).
- Dry mass (\(m_\text{dry}\)): ~8,000 kg.

**Calculation:**
Using the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation:
\[
\Delta v = I_\text{sp} \cdot g \cdot \ln\left(\frac{m_\text{wet}}{m_\text{dry}}\right)
\]
Rearranging for \(m_\text{wet}\):
\[
m_\text{wet} = m_\text{dry} \cdot e^{\frac{\Delta v}{I_\text{sp} \cdot g}}
\]
Substituting values:
\[
m_\text{wet} = 8,000 \cdot e^{\frac{40,000}{900 \cdot 9.81}} \approx 8,000 \cdot e^{4.52} \approx 8,000 \cdot 91.5 \approx 73,200 \, \text{kg}.
\]

**Results:**
- **Fuel mass**: \(m_\text{fuel} = m_\text{wet} - m_\text{dry} \approx 73,200 - 8,000 = 65,200 \, \text{kg}\).
- **Total launch mass**: ~73,200 kg.

#### **8. Tank Volume**

- Liquid hydrogen density: ~\(70 \, \text{kg/m}^3\).
- Volume required:
\[
V = \frac{m_\text{fuel}}{\text{Density}} \approx \frac{65,200}{70} \approx 930 \, \text{m}^3.
\]
With insulation and structural considerations: **~1,100 m³**.

---

#### **9. Dimensions**

- **Overall length**: ~20-30 meters (including tanks and propulsion system).
- **Tank diameter**: 3-5 meters (depending on configuration).
- **Launch mass (LEO)**: ~73 tons.

---

### **Plausibility Check**

- **Fuel Requirements**: 65 tons of liquid hydrogen for \(\Delta v\) of 40 km/s is realistic for nuclear thermal propulsion.
- **Payload and Structure Mass**: Reasonable for modern spacecraft design.
- **Tank Volume**: ~1,100 m³ for liquid hydrogen is plausible with current insulation technology.
- **Launch Mass**: 73 tons is within the capacity of modern heavy-lift rockets like SpaceX Starship.

**Conclusion**: All calculations and assumptions are technically consistent. The mission is both physically and technologically feasible.
