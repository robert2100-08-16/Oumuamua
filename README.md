**Introduction**
    
ʻOumuamua, discovered on October 19, 2017, is the first known interstellar object to visit our solar system. Its unusual speed and shape intrigued scientists, but limited observation time left many questions unanswered. The "Oumuamua Horizon" mission seeks to track, study, and analyze this enigmatic visitor to uncover its composition and origins.
    
**Mission Objectives**
1. **Catch Up to ʻOumuamua:** Develop a spacecraft capable of surpassing ʻOumuamua’s speed (~26.33 km/s) and reaching it within approximately five years.
2. **Fly Alongside and Investigate:** Utilize advanced instruments to examine ʻOumuamua’s composition, structure, and physical properties from a close distance.
3. **Deploy a Lander:** Send a robotic lander to ʻOumuamua’s surface for direct sample analysis and detailed surface studies.
    
**Technological Variants**
- **Nuclear Thermal Propulsion:** Utilizes a nuclear reactor to heat liquid hydrogen, offering high efficiency with a specific impulse of ~900 seconds. This mature technology, similar to NASA’s NERVA program, is feasible for a 2030 launch but presents challenges with cryogenic tanks and reactor integration.
- **Solar or Laser-Powered Lightsail:** Employs a large reflective sail accelerated by lasers or solar energy, potentially reaching speeds of 0.1-0.2 c. However, the necessary laser infrastructure is not yet available, making this option less viable for the 2030 timeline.
    
**Mission Plan**
1. **Launch and Acceleration:** Deploy the spacecraft to low Earth orbit using a heavy-lift rocket, then accelerate it to over 40 km/s using nuclear propulsion.
2. **Chasing ʻOumuamua:** After a five-year journey, align the spacecraft’s trajectory parallel to ʻOumuamua.
3. **Data Collection:** Conduct close-range studies, capturing high-resolution images and analyzing chemical and physical properties.
4. **Deploying the Lander:** Land a robotic probe on ʻOumuamua’s surface to perform on-site sample analysis.
5. **Data Transmission:** Relay all gathered data back to Earth via the Deep Space Network, with the entire mission spanning 10-15 years.
    
**Cost and Feasibility**
Estimated at ~$1.5-2 billion USD, the mission aligns with the costs of other complex interplanetary missions. A development period of six to eight years supports a feasible 2030 launch.
    
**Technical Feasibility**
- **Mass and Fuel Requirements:** The spacecraft’s total mass is projected between 7,000-8,500 kg, with a launch mass of approximately 73 tons, manageable by current heavy-lift rockets like SpaceX Starship.
- **Propulsion and Tank Volume:** Requires 65 tons of liquid hydrogen, feasible with existing insulation and propulsion technologies.
- **Overall Plausibility:** All technical aspects, including payload, structure, and propulsion, are consistent and achievable with current technology, ensuring the mission's feasibility.
    
**Conclusion**
The "Oumuamua Horizon" mission presents a technically and financially viable plan to explore ʻOumuamua up close. Utilizing nuclear thermal propulsion, the mission aims to provide unprecedented insights into interstellar objects, advancing our understanding of their composition and origins.
